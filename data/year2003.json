McIntosh climbed onto the roof of the restaurant and poured several gallons of gasoline over it, before igniting the fuel; the arson caused $5,000 in damages, but there were no casualties in the incident.  After setting the fire, McIntosh called the Seattle arson tip line and left a message claiming the incident in the name of both ELF and ALF, and stated that more incidents were to come, \"as long as McDonald's keeps hurting our furry brothers.\"  He was linked to the fire due to spray paint and sunglasses left at the scene.  In December 2005, McIntosh was sentenced to 8 years in prison after pleading guilty to charges in September of that year.","crit1":"1","crit2":"1","crit3":"1","doubtterr":"0","alternative":"","alternative_txt":".","multiple":"0","success":"1","suicide":"0","attacktype1":"7","attacktype1_txt":"Facility/Infrastructure Attack","attacktype2":"","attacktype2_txt":".","attacktype3":"","attacktype3_txt":".","targtype1":"1","targtype1_txt":"Business","targsubtype1":"2","targsubtype1_txt":"Restaurant/Bar/Caf��","corp1":"McDonald's fast food restaurants","target1":"McDonald's fast food restaurant across the street from the Space needle in Seattle, WA","natlty1":"217","natlty1_txt":"United States","targtype2":"","targtype2_txt":".","targsubtype2":"","targsubtype2_txt":".","corp2":"","target2":"","natlty2":"","natlty2_txt":".","targtype3":"","targtype3_txt":".","targsubtype3":"","targsubtype3_txt":".","corp3":"","target3":"","natlty3":"","natlty3_txt":".","gname":"Earth Liberation Front (ELF)","gsubname":"","gname2":"","gsubname2":"","gname3":"","ingroup":"20147","ingroup2":"","ingroup3":"","gsubname3":"","motive":"McIntosh was against the destruction of the earth and the harm of animals,  which he believed McDonald's was promoting through their work.","guncertain1":"0","guncertain2":"","guncertain3":"","nperps":"1","nperpcap":"1","claimed":"1","claimmode":"2","claimmode_txt":"Call (post-incident)","claim2":"","claimmode2":"","claimmode2_txt":".","claim3":"","claimmode3":"","claimmode3_txt":".","compclaim":"","weaptype1":"8","weaptype1_txt":"Incendiary","weapsubtype1":"20","weapsubtype1_txt":"Gasoline or Alcohol","weaptype2":"","weaptype2_txt":".","weapsubtype2":"","weapsubtype2_txt":".","weaptype3":"","weaptype3_txt":".","weapsubtype3":"","weapsubtype3_txt":".","weaptype4":"","weaptype4_txt":".","weapsubtype4":"","weapsubtype4_txt":".","weapdetail":"several gallons of gasoline ignited","nkill":"0","nkillus":"0","nkillter":"0","nwound":"0","nwoundus":"0","nwoundte":"0","property":"1","propextent":"3","propextent_txt":"Minor (likely < $1 million)","propvalue":"5000","propcomment":"","ishostkid":"0","nhostkid":"","nhostkidus":"","nhours":"","ndays":"","divert":"","kidhijcountry":"","ransom":"0","ransomamt":"","ransomamtus":"","ransompaid":"","ransompaidus":"","ransomnote":"","hostkidoutcome":"","hostkidoutcome_txt":".","nreleased":"","addnotes":"","scite1":"Paul Shukovsky, \"Arsonist gets 8 years for McDonald's fire; Activist tells judge of desire to help earth,\" Seattle Post-Intelligencer, December 17, 2005.","scite2":"\"Guilty plea in Seattle McDonald's fire,\" United Press International, September 27, 2005.","scite3":"Peter Lewis, \"8-year sentence for 2003 arson at eatery,\" Seattle Times, December 17, 2005.","dbsource":"Eco Project 2010","INT_LOG":"0","INT_IDEO":"1","INT_MISC":"0","INT_ANY":"1","related":""},{"eventid":"200301210001","iyear":"2003","imonth":"1","iday":"21","approxdate":"","extended":"0","resolution":"","country":"106","country_txt":"Kuwait","region":"10","region_txt":"Middle East & North Africa","provstate":"Asimah","city":"Kuwait","latitude":"29.365","longitude":"48.001389","specificity":"1","vicinity":"1","location":"The victims were traveling on Highway 85 near Camp Doha on the outskirts of Kuwait City.","summary":"01/21/2003: A vehicle carrying two American contractors was fired upon in Kuwait leaving Michael Rene Pouliot dead and David Caraway injured.

Gregg's cab stopped at traffic lights at the juntion of Nelson and Great George's Streets when it was ambushed. Gregg was killed, along with another UDA member in the vehicle, Robert Carson.  The driver and another passenger, who was Gregg's son, suffered injuries. Gregg died almost instanteously with a bullet to the brain.  Two suspects were arrested on 02/02/2003, but were later released with no charges filed. The UDA, Ulster Police, and Northern Ireland politicians believe that a splinter group of the UDA, the Red Hand Defenders (RHD), led by the then-incarcerated Johnny \"Mad Dog\" Adair, were behind the killings--an assertion confirmed in the three days after the shooting. The UDA gave Adair's group until 02/06/2003 to renounce loyalty to Adair, and in response Adair's supporters largely fled to Scotland throughout February 2003. On 02/22/2003, the UDA announced a one-year ceasfire, and no one has been arrested over the incident.

Colombia's National Police Chief blamed FARC for the incident and speculated that FARC was plotting to strike President Uribe's aircraft as it landed or took off from Neiva's airport, because of the manner of setup and positioning of the explosives found.","crit1":"1","crit2":"1","crit3":"1","doubtterr":"0","alternative":"","alternative_txt":".","multiple":"0","success":"1","suicide":"0","attacktype1":"3","attacktype1_txt":"Bombing/Explosion","attacktype2":"","attacktype2_txt":".","attacktype3":"","attacktype3_txt":".","targtype1":"2","targtype1_txt":"Government (General)","targsubtype1":"17","targsubtype1_txt":"Head of State","corp1":"Colombia President Alvaro Uribe","target1":"Colombia President Uribe's plane in Neiva","natlty1":"45","natlty1_txt":"Colombia","targtype2":"","targtype2_txt":".","targsubtype2":"","targsubtype2_txt":".","corp2":"","target2":"","natlty2":"","natlty2_txt":".","targtype3":"","targtype3_txt":".","targsubtype3":"","targsubtype3_txt":".","corp3":"","target3":"","natlty3":"","natlty3_txt":".","gname":"Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)","gsubname":"","gname2":"","gsubname2":"","gname3":"","ingroup":"576","ingroup2":"","ingroup3":"","gsubname3":"","motive":"Unknown","guncertain1":"1","guncertain2":"","guncertain3":"","nperps":"","nperpcap":"0","claimed":"0","claimmode":"","claimmode_txt":".","claim2":"","claimmode2":"","claimmode2_txt":".","claim3":"","claimmode3":"","claimmode3_txt":".","compclaim":"","weaptype1":"6","weaptype1_txt":"Explosives/Bombs/Dynamite","weapsubtype1":"16","weapsubtype1_txt":"Unknown Explosive Type","weaptype2":"","weaptype2_txt":".","weapsubtype2":"","weapsubtype2_txt":".","weaptype3":"","weaptype3_txt":".","weapsubtype3":"","weapsubtype3_txt":".","weaptype4":"","weaptype4_txt":".","weapsubtype4":"","weapsubtype4_txt":".","weapdetail":"","nkill":"18","nkillus":"0","nkillter":"","nwound":"37","nwoundus":"0","nwoundte":"","property":"1","propextent":"2","propextent_txt":"Major (likely > $1 million but < $1 billion)","propvalue":"","propcomment":"As over 70 houses were damaged or destroyed, plus mostly likely some roads and other infrastructure, overall property damage was significant.","ishostkid":"0","nhostkid":"","nhostkidus":"","nhours":"","ndays":"","divert":"","kidhijcountry":"","ransom":"","ransomamt":"","ransomamtus":"","ransompaid":"","ransompaidus":"","ransomnote":"","hostkidoutcome":"","hostkidoutcome_txt":".","nreleased":"","addnotes":"Neiva is about 250 miles south of Colombia's capital Bogota.","scite1":"\"Colombia: Explosion in Neiva Claims 6 Lives, Injures 15,\" Caracol Colombia Radio (WWW-Text), February 14, 2003.","scite2":"Isabel Sanchez, \"Rebel bomb kills 18 in southwestern Colombia ahead of president's visit,\" AFP, February 15, 2003.","scite3":"Michael Easterbrook, \"Authorities search for Americans allegedly abducted by Colombian rebels,\" AP, February 15, 2003.","dbsource":"CETIS","INT_LOG":"0","INT_IDEO":"0","INT_MISC":"0","INT_ANY":"0","related":""},{"eventid":"200302140002","iyear":"2003","imonth":"2","iday":"14","approxdate":"","extended":"0","resolution":"","country":"118","country_txt":"Macedonia","region":"9","region_txt":"Eastern Europe","provstate":"Struga municipality","city":"Struga","latitude":"41.18","longitude":"20.68","specificity":"1","vicinity":"0","location":"The Basic Court in Struga","summary":"2/14/2003: A bomb exploded at the Basic Court in Struga, Struga municipality, Macedonia.
