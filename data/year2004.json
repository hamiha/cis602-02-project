Seven people were killed while Thomas Hamill and Spc. Keith M. Maupin, were taken hostage. The insurgents demanded that the US remove their soldiers from the area or they would mutilate and behead the hostages. Hamill was in captivity for about three weeks when he managed to escape on May 2, 2004. Maupin was shot in the back of the head by his masked captors on Arabic television on June 29, 2004. In 2009 an unnamed al Qa'ida leader reportedly confessed to killing Maupin.","crit1":"1","crit2":"1","crit3":"1","doubtterr":"0","alternative":"","alternative_txt":".","multiple":"0","success":"1","suicide":"0","attacktype1":"6","attacktype1_txt":"Hostage Taking (Kidnapping)","attacktype2":"2","attacktype2_txt":"Armed Assault","attacktype3":"","attacktype3_txt":".","targtype1":"14","targtype1_txt":"Private Citizens & Property","targsubtype1":"68","targsubtype1_txt":"Named Civilian","corp1":"Civilians","target1":"Thomas Hamill and Spc.
